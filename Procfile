If Vercel is not suitable for your needs, you can consider using other free hosting services like [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [Deta](https://www.deta.sh/). Both platforms offer free tiers that can be used to deploy your Telegram bot.

### Deploying on Railway

Railway is a cloud platform that offers free hosting for small projects. Here are the steps to deploy your bot on Railway:

1. **Create a `Procfile`** to specify the command to run your bot.
2. **Create a `requirements.txt`** file if not already created.
3. **Create a `runtime.txt`** to specify the Python version.
4. **Initialize a Git repository** and push your code to Railway.
